      <p>The Sternwood Estate holds dominion over oil, which was the catalyst of Batam's transformation into Harbour Bay. However, by the time Johnny Light arrived in the city, this precious resource had seemed to run out.</p>
      <p>Two outsiders have become family heads over the course of history: Alaric Rochefort and Nathaniel Luca. Both were involved with the Cassano family--though this mutual fact was not known by anyone.</p>

      <p>Both Lewin Grayle and Elsa Grayle were master architects--or urbatects--who aimed to turn Batam/Harbour Bay into their own playground--even though only Lewin had disclosed himself, keeping Elsa's contributions secret. The tension between them exploded after Vivian Sternwood got married to Alaric, after which Elsa faked her own death and reinvented herself as Helena Grayle.</p>
      <p>After turning Lewin into an invalid, Helena took over the Meisterstadt project. The new city was already established when Johnny Light arrived in Harbour Bay.</p>

      <p>The Mirdads came from a matriarchal society in which the woman led her own harem. Over the course of her twenties, Nana Mirdad had accumulated dozens of lovers, stationed in various important places across the globe. It was this network of connections that enabled her to control the mass media in Harbour Bay.</p>
      <p>After the attack of Moose Malloy in 2010, Nana had reverted to her feral ways, which ultimately led to a grotesque death in her own Count Zaroff-esque island.</p>

      <p>At the decisive manslaughter that brought the Nobles' victory, the original Kingsleys were drowned by the local pirates. A mysterious young girl who called herself Madeleine Kingsley was then appointed as the Head of the Estate.</p>

      <p>Without the might of Mario Kusanagi--previously Mario Minakami of the Kudo Clan--the Nobles would have never won the war. When he kept his honor from the seduction of a local woman sent by BP Batam, a curse was inflicted upon his body, causing a condition similar to a degenerative disease. He met his demise in the hands of Moose Malloy.</p>
      <p>Years later, his sister Kasumi Kusanagi struck a deal with Helena Grayle to annul the Kusanagi's noble status, providing freedom to rule over Harbour Bay's underworld.</p>
      <p>The Kusanagi has always been somewhat allied with the Edel personages since then--Kasumi with Terry Koh, Yu Murata with Johnny Light, and Ayako Yoshida with Minjeong Cassano.</p>
